Hi there,

Welcome to my academic webpage. I am interested in Theoretical Compter Science and Quantum Computing. Motivated by problems in statistical mechanics, I am currently thinking about:
- Estimation algorithms for $QMA$-hard, $QMA_{exp}$, \# P-hard, ... problems.
Such problems could include the estimation of the partition function or the relatedly, the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian with certain properties, such as locality, translational invariance, and etc.

You can find my [CV](http://arsalan-motamedi.github.io/CV.pdf) here.
