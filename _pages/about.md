Hi there,

Welcome to my academic webpage. I am interested in Theoretical Compter Science and Quantum Computing. Here is a set of questions that I am currently thinking about:
- Counting problems, especially approximate algorithms for #P-hard problems.
- Classical estimation algorithms for $\text{QMA}$-hard, $\text{QMA}_{exp}$, ... problems. (How well can we compute properties of the real 'quantum' world via our computers).
You can find my [CV](http://arsalan-motamedi.github.io/CV.pdf) here.
