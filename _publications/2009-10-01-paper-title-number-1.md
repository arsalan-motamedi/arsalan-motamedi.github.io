collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We provide a rigorous analysis of Fourier interpolation method, and the quntum advantages that it may offer through quantum Foutier transform. We then use this approach to design a Gibbs sampler with provable polylog dependence on the error parameter.'
